# is_vision
This is a ROS indigo package for handling basic vision processing using a kinect sensor for tracking a pioneer robot. I developed this package as a part of my independent study with Marcello Balduccini.


Install
-------------
To install this ros package simply place in the source folder in your catkin workspace, ususally found ~/catkin_ws/src/ then update your catkin settings by sourcing the bash script catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash then finally make the package using catkin_make at the toplevel catkin_ws directory.
